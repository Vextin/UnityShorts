# UnityShorts
Scripts for youtube shorts, posted on my youtube -> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqnQSi0X-yFWrnOnwKigSzA

I make these scripts to help others learn. 

## Can I use these in my game?
Yes, you can sell your game if it uses this script. The only requirement of the MIT license is that you credit me and ship the license notice along with your game. (in, say, a "licensing.txt" file)
